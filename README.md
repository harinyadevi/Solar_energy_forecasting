# Solar_energy_forecasting
Solar energy is one of the leading renewable energy sources in the world and it continues to grow. However, it depends on sunlight which is an intermittent natural resource. This makes power output predictability critical for the integration of solar photovoltaics into traditional electrical grid systems.

This solar energy dataset consitsts of solar data and this can be used for forecasting the amount of energy consumed in future. The dataset consists of data of the year 2020 and it consists of 5137 rows and comprises of 8 columns.

Standard data science and time series analysis techniques have been applied to the dataset and the trends/seasonality have been observed and relevant inferences are made to further predict the solar energy that will be generated.
